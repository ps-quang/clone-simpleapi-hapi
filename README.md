# `simpleapi-hapi`

This is a [Hapi](https://hapi.dev) service that returns the example JSON from MDN's `fetch()` [documentation](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/main/fetch/fetch-json/products.json).


## Usage

Once the requirements are install with `npm install` use `npm run serve` to start the server:

```
> npm run serve
```

The service can now be accessed via http://localhost:3000/

Test cases can be ran with:

```
> npm test
```

## Purpose

This sample project has been created as a basic project that can be used to explore Github Actions.
